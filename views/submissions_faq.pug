				h4 Do I have to sign up with a performing rights organization?
				p If you’re signed up, great! If you’re not, we will take care of that. We register all songs/tracks with performing rights societies then track and collect your royalties, to save you money and time to do what you do best.

				h4 Do I have a say in licensing proposals?
				p No! We retain rights to negotiate all licensing on songs/tracks assigned.

				h2(style="margin:50px 0") Submission/Selection Process

				h3 Is there an age limit to submit music?
				p Legally you must be over 16 years old.

				h3 Registration?
				p To register you must have a PayPal account to submit music and to get paid.

				h3 To complete the application process?
				p Application rules include: a guarantee that material submitted is yours (written and recorded by you or jointly). DO NOT SEND tracks that may infringe on others' copyright. Submit your own songs please.

				h3 What happens if my music is not chosen?
				p We will inform you by e-mail and delete all tracks submitted including the online agreement.

				h3 How will I know if my music has been selected?
				p You will receive an Accept or Decline confirmation within 10–30 days.

				h3 What happens once my music has been selected?
				p Your music joins our catalogue of great music and is promoted worldwide.

				h3 Which music format do I submit?
				p We require a WAV file resolution that’s easy to work with.

				h3 What about samples?
				p No sampled songs, NO COVERS! We respect original songs only.

				h3 How many songs can I submit?
				p A maximum of 4 songs/tracks initially and if your music is great, a further 4 songs/tracks thereafter.

				h3 Why is our License exclusive?
				p Exclusivity is what clients prefer. If your song/tracks are exclusively assigned, clients find it more favorable, rather than if it’s being added on multiple licensing platforms.

				p Not generally; however, if it’s required we will let you know.
